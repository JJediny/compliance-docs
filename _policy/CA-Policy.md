# {{ site.data.ssp.system }} Security Assessment and Authorization Policy

## 1. Purpose of Policy
Security Assessment and Authorization, formerly Certification and Accreditation, is a process of identifying, analyzing and understanding information assets, possible impact of security risks, weaknesses and threats in order to apply appropriate security measures. It is a federal requirement to assess and authorize information technology systems in accordance with FISMA the Federal Risk and Authorization and Management Program and is based on NIST Special Publication 800-37, Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems

This Policy establishes the basis for implementing a security assessment and authorization policy and practices for protecting information systems and data within {{ site.data.ssp.system }} systems, products and networks.

The {{ site.data.ssp.system }} program includes a library of security policies that address federal and commercial requirements. These policies guide and govern the actions of {{ site.data.ssp.system }} employees and contractors in conducting any United States (U.S.) business.

This policy is written and includes the following:
* Security assessments
* Information System Connections
* Security Certification
* Plan of Action and Milestones
* Security Authorization
* Continuous Monitoring
* Penetration Testing
* Internal System Connections

## 2. Scope of Policy
This policy applies to all users, systems, networks, components, services and processes in or accessing the {{ site.data.ssp.system }} Production environment, and all services, applications and products in General Availability.  This includes cloud infrastructure components, leveraged services and other elements used to deliver {{ site.data.ssp.system }} products and services.

Please see the {{ site.data.ssp.system }} Governance Policy for further information on Management Commitment, Compliance and Enforcement, Review & Update processes, and Penalties.

## 3. Policy
The access and use of Information Technology (IT) resources shall be in compliance with applicable Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications, International Organization for Standards (ISO) and {{ site.data.ssp.system }} policies and standards.

### Security Assessments
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will implement a security assessment plan that;
 * Describes security controls and control enhancements under assessment;
 * Defines assessment procedures used to determine security control effectiveness; and
 * Defines assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities.
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will conduct annual assessment to ensure controls are implemented correctly, operating, and producing the desire artifacts;
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will generate a Security Assessment Report and documents the outcome of annual assessment; and
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will provide results of assessment, in writing, to authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative.
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will engage the services of an independent assessor/team to conduct assessment of the security controls.

### Information System Connections
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will authorize any connections from the information system to other systems, outside the authorization boundary, through the use of * Interconnection Security Agreements;
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will document, for each connection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, and the nature of the information communicated; and
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will monitor the information system connections on an ongoing basis, verifying enforcement of security requirements.

### Plan of Action and Milestones
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will establish a plan of action and milestone for the information system to document the organizationâ€™s planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will update existing plan of action and milestone monthly based on the findings from security controls assessments, security impact analysis and continuous monitoring activities.

### Security Authorization
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will assign a senior-level executive or manager to the role of authorizing official for the information system;
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will ensure that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for processing before commencing operations; and
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will update the security authorization on an annual basis.

### Continuous Monitoring
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will implement a configuration management process for the information system and its constituent components;
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will make a determination of the security impact of changes to the information system and environment of operations;
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will conduct ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy; and
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will report security state of the information system to appropriate organizational officials on an annual basis.

### Penetration Testing
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} will employ the use of an independent penetration agent or penetration team to perform penetration testing on its information system or system components
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} if needed will employ authorized red team exercises to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems in accordance with approved rules of engagement.

### Internal System Connections
* {{ site.data.ssp.system }} Authorizes internal connections of information system components or classes of components to the information systems
* Ensure to document for each internal connection, the interface characteristics, security requirements, and the nature of the information communicated.
